# Build the standalone KiroCrew desktop app end-to-end.
#
# Pipeline (uses the python-build-standalone approach):
#   1. Build the React dashboard (npm)         -> website/dist
#   2. Provision a python-build-standalone (PBS) interpreter via uv
#   3. pip-install kiro_crew + deps INTO the bundled interpreter
#   4. Stage the dashboard into the package's static dir
#   5. Prune caches/tests/unused stdlib to shrink the bundle
#   6. Package the desktop app with electron-builder -> DMG (mac) / AppImage (linux)
#
# The result is a double-clickable app that embeds the whole Python backend +
# dashboard — no system Python, pip, npm, or node required by the end user.
#
# PBS interpreters are self-contained
# and use @executable_path-relative dylib references, so the bundle is genuinely
# portable across machines without needing the exact same system Python version.
#
# ARCHITECTURE: on macOS this builds ONE universal .app/DMG by default: the
# Electron shell is lipo-merged (arm64 + x86_64) by electron-builder, and the
# backend — which cannot be lipo-merged (a whole PBS tree, not one binary) —
# ships as TWO complete trees (backend-dist/kirocrew-backend-arm64/ and
# .../kirocrew-backend-x64/), selected at launch by find-bin.js via
# process.arch. The x86_64 backend is built under Rosetta 2, so the universal
# build needs an Apple-Silicon host. Linux always builds host-arch only
# (AppImage). UNIVERSAL=0 forces a host-arch-only macOS build (faster local
# iteration, or the only option on an Intel Mac).
#
# Usage:
#   bash packaging/build-desktop.sh            # macOS: universal DMG · Linux: host arch
#   UNIVERSAL=0 bash packaging/...             # macOS: host-arch-only DMG
#   SKIP_FRONTEND=1 bash packaging/...         # reuse an already-staged dist
#   SKIP_ELECTRON=1 bash packaging/...         # stop after the backend binary

      # %APPDATA%\<name> -- so uninstalling either channel would delete the
      # other's pending update download, its differential baseline, and its

      # Squirrel.Windows keyed the INSTALL identity off squirrelWindows.name;
      # NSIS keys it off two separate things, and nightly needs both:
      #
      # 1. The uninstall/upgrade registry key is a GUID, defaulting to
      #    UUID v5(appId) (app-builder-lib NsisTarget.js: `options.guid ||
      #    UUID.v5(appInfo.id, ELECTRON_BUILDER_NS_UUID)`). Nightly shares
      #    appId with production (see above), so WITHOUT an explicit guid both
      #    channels claim one registry key and an assisted nightly install
      #    adopts -- then on uninstall removes -- the stable entry. The value
      #    below is exactly what electron-builder would derive from a
      #    hypothetical `com.amazon.kiro.crew.nightly` appId, so it is stable,
      #    reproducible, and collision-free without moving the real appId.
      # 2. The install DIRECTORY comes from productFilename (i.e. the spaced
      #    productName above) only because nsis.oneClick is false --
      #    getWindowsInstallationDirName() falls back to the npm package name
      #    under one-click. That is why the target is an assisted installer.
      #
      # As on mac, this identity persists on user machines from first install:
      # changing it later orphans installed updaters, so it is pinned from the
      # first shipped build.
      "-c.nsis.guid=0f417bf9-2759-51d6-acfb-f864805d1f41"
      # WINDOWS-ONLY appId split. The shared appId above is required on macOS
      # (Squirrel.Mac validates against the host's designated requirement, which
      # pins the bundle id), but on Windows it reaches ${APP_ID}, which the NSIS
      # template uses for two registrations that are global per-id rather than
      # per-install: WinShell::SetLnkAUMI stamps the AppUserModelID onto the
      # desktop and Start Menu shortcuts, and WinShell::UninstAppUserModelId
      # removes that registration outright.
      #
      # The update path is safe on its own: nsis.allowToChangeInstallationDirectory
      # is false, so that define is never emitted, setIsTryToKeepShortcuts always
      # yields "true", and the old uninstaller runs with --keep-shortcuts, which
      # skips the deregistration. A real UNINSTALL does not. Uninstall one
      # channel and WinShell::UninstAppUserModelId runs against the id BOTH
      # channels share, deregistering the AppUserModelID the surviving channel's
      # shortcuts still carry -- its desktop shortcut then resolves to a dead
      # registration and the shell reports that app as relocated or missing even
      # though its .exe is untouched.
      #
      # Scoped to `win` deliberately: appInfo.id prefers the platform-specific
      # value, so a top-level -c.appId would also move the macOS bundle id and
      # strand every installed mac app's updates. This is the same identity
      # main.js already claims at runtime via app.setAppUserModelId, so the
      # packaged shortcuts and the running process finally agree.
